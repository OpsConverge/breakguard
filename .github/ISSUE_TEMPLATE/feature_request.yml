        ⚠️ **Preview Release**

        BreakGuard is evolving quickly 🚧  
        Feature requests grounded in **real workflows** and **concrete examples** are most useful.

        🔒 **Support Repo Notice**
        This is a public support repository for BreakGuard.
        The extension source code is maintained in a private repository, so external PRs may not be possible.
        Feature ideas, examples, and expected behavior are extremely valuable.
