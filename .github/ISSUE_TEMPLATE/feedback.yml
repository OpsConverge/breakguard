        ⚠️ **Preview Release**

        BreakGuard is in preview 🚧  
        This template is for **general feedback** (UX, usefulness, clarity, missing polish).
        If you found a reproducible defect, use **🐞 Bug Report** instead.

        🔒 **Support Repo Notice**
        This is a public support repository for BreakGuard.
        The extension source code is maintained in a private repository, so external PRs may not be possible.
